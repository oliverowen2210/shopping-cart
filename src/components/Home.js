export default function Home(props) {
  return (
    <div className="home">
      <header>
        <div className="headerContent">
          <h1>This is a home page.</h1>
          <div className="thumbs" />
        </div>
      </header>
      <main>
        <p>
          A lot of home page text. There's really a lot of things to read here,
          if you were to sit down and read everything you might not finish for
          hours or even days. typing this all out made my hand hurt lol
        </p>
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
